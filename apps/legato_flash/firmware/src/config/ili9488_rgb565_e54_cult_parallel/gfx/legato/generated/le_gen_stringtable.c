 * unsigned short - number of indices in the table
 * unsigned byte - size of each index
 * unsigned byte - number of languages in the table
 * 
 * index array (size = number of indices * number of languages
 * 
 * for each index in the array:
 *   unsigned byte - the font ID for the index
 *   unsigned (index size) - a value of length 'index size' that contains

 *                           the table
 * 
 * string data is found by jumping to the index offset from the start
 * of the table
 *
