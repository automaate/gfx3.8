## Using a Third-Party Display Module

This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to run MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite with a third-party capacitive touch display module. For this tutorial, we will use a Mikroe TFT Proto 5\” Capacitive display module that is connected to a PIC3MZ EF Starter Kit. The display module has an 800x480 resolution display with an SSD1963 display controller, and a FT5306 capacitive touch controller. 

This tutorial requires knowledge of how to create an MPLAB Harmony project and using MPLAB Harmony Graphics Composer to design a screen. These processes will not be covered in this tutorial.
