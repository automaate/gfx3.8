MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite is not just a User Interface (UI) builder. It is a rich integrated development environment which shortens your time to market. It contains a graphics library written in C language, MPLAB Harmony drivers and hardware abstraction code, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designer, and a application configurator. The suite produces efficient code that runs on Microchip PIC32 PIC and SAM devices.

## Key Features

### Designer

MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite has its own integrated GUI [designer](Designer.html) tool. It is used to design and build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) from widgets contain in the graphics library. With its what-you-see-what-you-get (WYSWYG) editor, a complete layout can be created and managed.  

### Graphics Library

Graphics rendering and event-handling is made available through the [graphics library](GraphicsLibrary.html). The graphics library is a 2-Dimensional (2D) raster paint engine which support the drawing of a complete UI design on display modules using specific display controllers.

### Drivers

MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite provides integrated drivers and supports the capability to create custom [graphics drivers](Drivers.html) for low-level hardware communication to display and touch controllers. 

### Configurator

MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite provides MHC with a rich-set of [graphics configuration components](Configurator.html) for configuration and code generation. It produces custom code specific to the needs of a project. It provides a data setting environment to help bind modules, peripherals, widgets, memory, assets together into a final application for compilation.
