### KNOWN ISSUES

Current known issues are as follows:

* Code is compliant to MISRA C 2012 Mandatory guidelines, with the exception of Rule 9.1 (Code 530).
In gfx.c the variable args is falsely detected in violation of Code 530: &quot;Symbol not initialized&quot; at line 358.  In fact, va_start at line 358 is exactly where args is initialized.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.
* Configurations using xplained pro display do not support touch events. For example, aria_quickstart_e70_xult_xpro_spi.
* The Heap Estimator can be inaccurate with estimating PNG images that have high pixel fidelity.
* Project regeneration from command line can remove Aria generated screens and widgets.
* MHGC GAC does not generated a 2DGPU comaptible palette table. A translation step is required to create word values from little endian byte array.
* When regenerating demo applications, keep all code between comments //CUSTOM CODE and //END OF CUSTOM CODE. Custom code is added to perform specific functionality.
* PKOB4 debugging requires MPLAB v5.20.
* Applications running on SAM E70 in combination with LCC will observe visual rendering artifacts on display during SD card R/W access. There is no loss in SD Card data.
* Applications formatting SQI FAT in Linux use the following command: mkfs.fat -F12 /dev/$(device name)
* aria_quickstart_ext_res applications using mzda may show external memory starter kit image. The demonstration only uses internal stack DDR starter kit.
* FreeRTOS OSAL has an incorrect include path that causes build failures in non-Windows environments.
* SAM E54/D51 must be debugged using MPLABX v5.25
